# ShopClues E-commerce Clone

Developed a full-stack E-commerce platform (ShopClues Clone) with MERN stack, featuring authentication, cart, checkout, admin management, Stripe payments, and email workflows. Implemented sorting, filtering, and pagination with MongoDB/Mongoose. Deployed frontend on Vercel, backend on Render, and database on MongoDB Atlas, following CI/CD and environment variable practices for production readiness.

## Deployments  

The complete project i.e., frontend and backend is hosted on Render to avoid security and CORS issues.
